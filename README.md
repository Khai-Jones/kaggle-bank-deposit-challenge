# Kaggle Bank Challenge: Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains the solution for a Kaggle competition focused on predicting customer churn for a bank. The primary goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict which customers are most likely to leave the bank, based on a variety of provided features. This predictive insight can help the bank proactively target at-risk customers with retention strategies.
